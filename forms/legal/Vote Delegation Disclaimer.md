**Vote Delegation Disclaimer**

***Last updated: [DATE]***

Please be advised: 

I control the private key for externally owned account [PUBLIC KEY ADDRESS] (“My Address”), which has staked a certain amount of [DAO GOV TOKENS] tokens in the governance contract for [DAO]. I intend to participate in the governance of [DAO], whether by proposing, voting, abstaining, or engaging in related discourse or otherwise, in accordance with its applicable parameters and guidelines, and understand other externally owned accounts and addresses may delegate their voting power to My Address. In participating in the governance of [DAO], I am acting on my own behalf, but will seek to provide transparent, good faith and honest information as to my motivations and reasoning as to such participation when soliciting the delegation of voting power to My Address.

I currently have [economic interests in][contractual obligations with][other relationships with] [EMPLOYER/CONTRACTOR/ASSOCIATION/AFFILIATED ENTITY], and may engage in the [OTHER DAO(S) OR PROJECT(S)] community(ies) from time to time. I may have direct or indirect economic interests in the various projects, entities, networks, and protocols related to the foregoing, and I also use and hold various other cryptocurrencies, tokens, stablecoins and other digital assets from time to time, including but not limited to [____________].

In participating in the governance of [DAO], I am not acting on behalf of [EMPLOYER/CONTRACTOR/AFFILIATED ENTITY, nor][on behalf of any client, nor] any voting power delegator, whether or not such delegation was solicited. If my views expressed in governance contexts are interpreted or used in a manner that leads to some injury or detriment, there will be no legal recourse against me as a vote delegate or otherwise, nor will there be any coverage or indemnity from any applicable insurance or similar mechanism.

I assume no duty and provide no guarantee of keeping these disclosures up to date, nor of adjusting these disclosures for each applicable governance process, but will act in good faith when soliciting the delegation of voting power to My Address.

You may contact me at [EMAIL ADDRESS/COMMS HANDLES], though I assume no duty for, and cannot guarantee my responsiveness to or any action upon, any individual question, feedback, or request from a vote delegator.
